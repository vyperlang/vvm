[![Pypi Status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/vvm.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/vvm/) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/vyperlang/vvm/main.yaml?branch=master)](https://github.com/vyperlang/vvm/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/vyperlang/vvm)](https://codecov.io/gh/vyperlang/vvm)

Vyper version management tool.

## Installation

### via `pip`

```bash
pip install vvm
```

### via `setuptools`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vyperlang/vvm.git
cd vvm
python3 setup.py install
```

## Quickstart

Use `vvm` to install versions of Vyper:

```python
from vvm import install_vyper

install_vyper(version="0.4.0")
```

**Note**: On macOS with the Apple chips, installing some versions of Vyper may fail if you have not first run this
command:

```python
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

To install Vyper without validating the binary (which is useful in the case where you did first run the command above
but will later or are managing versions of Vyper without running them), you can set `skip_validation=False`.

```python
from vvm import install_vyper

install_vyper(version="0.4.0", validate=False)
```

## Testing

`vvm` is tested on Linux, OSX and Windows with Vyper versions `>=0.1.0-beta.16`.

To run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

By default, the test suite installs all available `vyper` versions for your OS. If you only wish to test against already installed versions, include the `--no-install` flag. Use the `--vyper-verions` flag to test against one or more specific versions.
